This repository contains basic bash environment settings
for my personal LAMP servers. Works on OSX also. 
Note that if you are using OSX, use the `.osx_bashrc` file and 
rename it to `.bashrc`

Included features:
------------------
- Solarized file & directory colors
- Grep highlighting
- Fancy command prompt, you may change the format
- And many many more.. :) 

However, this is just my command line environment setup.

For the full package, you should also install my 
[vim setup](https://github.com/codelucas/vimrc) for file editing and 
my [base-line shell scripts](https://github.com/codelucas/base_scripts) 
for monitoring processes and etc.

If you are curious on how the `.profile`, `.bashrc`, and other files all
work and sync together, please read [this excellent Stack Overflow post](http://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile).

If your directory and other files do not display colors for the `ls` command,
make sure `dircolors` is installed with `sudo apt-get install dircolors`.
On OSX, use `brew install coreutils`.
